              Hi, my name is Karan and I am a{" "} Machine Learning Engineer at Wells Fargo.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I did my M. Tech from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore in 2019-2021.
              I was in the Medical Imaging Group, in the Department of Computational and Data Science (CDS).
              My thesis was on Medical Image Synthesis using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I have a wide range of hobbies and passions that keep me busy.
              From reading, playing sports, and traveling.
              I am always seeking new experiences and love to keep myself
              engaged and learning new things.
            </p>
            <br />
            {/* <p>
              I believe that you should{" "}
              <span className="font-bold text-teal-500">
                never stop growing
              </span>{" "}
              and that&#39;s what I strive to do, I have a passion for
              technology and a desire to always push the limits of what is
              possible. I am excited to see where my career takes me and am
              always open to new opportunities. ðŸ™‚
